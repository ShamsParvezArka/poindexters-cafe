    parts of it's fur were glowing. At first, she was running-away from me. But as time passed,

    It reminded me of something-a bitter memory I often regret. I once had 2 bunnies. I raised

    I couldn't took proper care of them. I was the irresponsible one. This guild hunts me. Because
    of me, they never got to live their full lives.
